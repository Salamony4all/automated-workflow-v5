                  "description": "Architonic ID: 20327557Year of Launch: 2020One of the nature’s strongest textures, wood comes to light as a brand new design. Alek armchair series offer a simple naturalness with its oval-shaped wooden frame.Alek invites you to a comfortable seating experience. Its armrests and back are designed as a single structure. The cylindrical wooden legs extend diagonally from the armrest level to the ground, bringing an aesthetical contrast to the oval formed backrest. The warmth of wood dominates the visual impact as it unifies with a smooth cushion seat. 70 mm thick soft foam seat and the fresh look of wood reinforce the feeling of comfort.The wooden frame of Alek armchair comes in ash, walnut and black solid wood finishes as presented in the B&T Design’s solid wood catalogue.

              "description": "Architonic ID: 20309153Year of Launch: 2022The Wave family of dining and coffee tables is remarkable for its scenic presence and versatility, which give them a great sense of lightness. This is particularly evident in the design of the finely rounded legs, which create an interplay of volumes and contrast with the lightness of the table top.The table tops are available in 16 different types of marble and can be shaped rectangular or round, offering a variety of options to suit the taste and style of the surroundings. The choice of marble as a material lends a timeless elegance and sophistication to the tables.The table bases are made of steel and can be painted with Delabrè or Pewter metallic finishes.The versatility of the Wave family is further emphasised by the possibility of making the tables to measure. The bases can be adapted and interpreted according to the shape and size of the top, allowing for customised proposals of great aesthetic relevance.This makes Wave tables suitable "

              "description": "Architonic ID: 20309143Year of Launch: 2022The Ritz family of armchairs, sofas and sectional sofas is renowned for its elegant and timeless design. Its soft, refined lines lend an extraordinary sense of lightness to the back and armrests, further accentuated by the fine metal base. This feature makes them suitable not only for living spaces, but also for contract use, such as hotel lobbies or offices.An equally important element of this collection is their high degree of customisation. They can be made in a combination of colours and materials, for example, with the outer part of the armrests and backrest in leather, and the seat and back cushions and inner structure in fabric. Thanks to the wide choice of leathers, fabrics and imitation leathers available, endless customisation solutions are possible. Even the metal base can be finished in over 20 different finishes, depending on the context and aesthetic preferences.Read more Architonic ID: 20309143Year of Launch: 2022 Architonic ID:"

              "description": "Architonic ID: 20309155Year of Launch: 2022The Wave family of dining and coffee tables is remarkable for its scenic presence and versatility, which give them a great sense of lightness. This is particularly evident in the design of the finely rounded legs, which create an interplay of volumes and contrast with the lightness of the table top.The table tops are available in 16 different types of marble and can be shaped rectangular or round, offering a variety of options to suit the taste and style of the surroundings. The choice of marble as a material lends a timeless elegance and sophistication to the tables.The table bases are made of steel and can be painted with Delabrè or Pewter metallic finishes.The versatility of the Wave family is further emphasised by the possibility of making the tables to measure. The bases can be adapted and interpreted according to the shape and size of the top, allowing for customised proposals of great aesthetic relevance.This makes Wave tables suitable "

After years of triumph and satisfaction with the Stripes collection, we decided to embark on a journey of renewal, making slight changes to the shape and structure to offer an even more enveloping experience.At the heart of this evolution lies the desire to lighten and soften the geometries of the original product, creating a more welcoming and comfortable environment.
